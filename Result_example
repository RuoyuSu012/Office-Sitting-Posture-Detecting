When you run the code, you will see the real-time person's posture status and the results.

The following are the results' explanations

1. Processing time1
    - Indicate the time taken from the start of the program to the completion of the key points detection of the person.

2. Processing time2
    - Indicate the time taken from the start of the program to the completion of keypoint plotting.

<note: These times are used to evaluate the processing speed and performance of the code during critical steps>

3. Leg status
    - Both Legs Kneeling / Not Kneeling / Legs not detected

4. Hand status
    - Not Folding Hands / Folding Hands / Unable to detect arm joints

5. Back status
    - Hunchback / Reclined / Straight

6. Current posture status
    - Bad posture / Unknown(good) posture
    - This result depends on the above results of leg, hand, and back status. This result is real-time.

7. Percentage
    - Represent the percentage of “bad posture” in the last 10 tests

8. Remind
    - If percentage > 80, the vibrator on the table will vibrate and there will be a reminder of message "Bad posture, You need to adjust your sitting posture!"
